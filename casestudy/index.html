                <h1>MY ROLE</h1>
                <p>I worked individually to develop a web-based application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                <h1>CONTEXT & CHALLENGE</h1>
                <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p>I learned to build a unique application that takes advantage of gestures and accelerometers. Special consideration was given to limited screen real estate, low bandwidth internet access, no internet access, and touch screen devices.</p>
                <h2>GOALS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn new techniques along with the best practices in mobile app design and development</li>
                <li>Have a comprehensive understanding of designing and developing interactive web applications for modern mobile devices</li>
                <li>Successfully build out a fully functional mobile app by focusing on design and user experience</li>

                <h1>PROCESS & INSIGHT</h1>
                <h2>CHOOSING THE IDEA</h2>
                <p>My goal was to choose an application with one core function. I decided on an interval timer because it is a tool that I consistently use. I started with brainstorming a potential layout by sketching out the screens. Next, I pulled inspiration from existing apps and styles that I could include in my interface. I had to keep in account the screen real estate as well as hit sizes when using mobile.</p>
            

                <h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1>
                <h2>ALPHA</h2>
                <p>My main priority for the alpha was making sure I was able to code out all of the screens for the web app and to also make sure the buttons are functional. I implemented a modal that opens once you hit the start button.</p>
                <p>I was also able to incorporate the "add to home screen" functionality using JavaScript that alerts the user a couple seconds after they visit the page. I decided that due to feasibility, I was going to focus on getting the timer to function rather than the progress bar. The second image just consists of a placeholder, so my next focus was coding it out.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I added a screen that alerts the user to turn the screen back to portrait mode if they were to flip their phone to landscape.</p>
                
            <div class="image_row">
                <a href="#img1">
                <img class="alpha" src="images/alpha.png" alt="alpha">
                </a>
                <a href="#" class="lightbox" id="img1">
                    <span style="background-image: url('images/alpha.png')"></span>
                  </a>

                  <a href="#img6">
                    <img src="images/horizontal.png" alt="horizontal">
                    </a>

                    <a href="#" class="lightbox" id="img6">
                        <span style="background-image: url('images/horizontal.png')"></span>
                      </a>
             </div>

                <h2>BETA</h2>
                <p>The focus for the beta was adding functionality to the timer and making sure the input matched the output. There was some troubleshooting involved when it came to making sure the timer was functioning properly. This mainly consisted of fixing the JavaScript so that when the user hits start, the correct settings would appear in the timer. I also solved the issue of having the timer skip numbers or going too fast by removing some lines of code out of the loop and incorporating a reset function that reset the settings once the user quit out of the modal.</p>
                
                <div class="beta_container">
                <a href="#img2">
                <img class="beta" src="images/gif.gif" alt="beta">
                </a>
                </div>

                <a href="#" class="lightbox" id="img2">
                    <span style="background-image: url('images/gif.gif')"></span>

            <div class="solution">
                <h1>RESULTS</h1>
                <h2>FINAL</h2>
                <p>The biggest focus for the final was implementing localStorage functionality, so that the user could quit out of the app and open it again with the same settings they chose before. Because the settings consisted of numbers, there was a challenge of converting the strings into interval variables after checking local storage for information. This consisted of loops that read the data and then wrote it, and I worked to debug this by checking the local storage in the browser until the changes I made starting working. <br> <br> After fixing the issue of the timer and implementing localStorage, the timer was functioning properly and the final project was completed. The app could successfully be downloaded to the home screen, function properly, and save user input once closed and reopened.</p>

                <img class="localstorage" src="images/localstorage.png" alt="localstorage">

                <a href="#" class="lightbox" id="img5">
                    <span style="background-image: url('images/localstorage.png')"></span>
                  </a>

                </div>
                <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
                <p>The biggest takeaway was learning the best practices when it comes to web applications. I got to freshen up on my JavaScript and other features like adding the app to the homescreen, cache manifest, and local storage. I was able to debug with some assistance and by using critical thinking skills. </p>
